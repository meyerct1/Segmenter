% VERSION
% 1.0.1
%
% INPUT:
% dir_name      = directory name
% id            = regular expression
% dir_recurse   = true to recurse inside the directory
%
% OUTPUT:
% f             = struct containing the file list
%                 pathstr   -> the path of the file
%                 name      -> name of the file (no extension)
%                 ext       -> extension of the file
%                 versn     -> version info
%                 filename  -> entire filename
%
% EXAMPLE:
%
% Remove all the temporary files created by Matlab
%
% f = get_file_list('/Users/zuliani/Research', '.m~', true);
% for h = 1:numel(f)
%   delete(f(h).filename);
